# IPLookupMap
Simple IP lookup with google map support.
I recently discorvered that we could download what facebook hold on us (https://facebook.com/settings).
There is an IP section in there, I wanted to visualize, on a map, from where my facebook account was logged into.
I know there is probably 1000 other project just like this one, but who can say no to a Developer trip once in a while.
